Some interesting things I read in January, with a fits-in-a-tweet summary:

* "The single biggest problem with communication is the illusion that it has taken place". Keep everyone updated and beware that great communication is honest, relevant, respectful, and concise.

* "No, dynamic type systems are not inherently more open". Static langs just make **the assumptions you have to do** explicit. We should talk about structural vs nominal instead of dynamic vs static. In fact, they are orthogonal distinctions!

* If you don't know yet, on 2038-01-19 the Unix time will exceed the size of a signed 32-bit integer. The Y2038 problem will be giving us headaches long, long before 2038 arrives!

* The Wall of Technical Debt:
  1) make it visible with a physical wall, avoid it to be hidden in a digital tool.
  2) build an habit to keep it aligned.
  3) negotiate about adding/fixing/avoiding regularly.
  4) give away control.
