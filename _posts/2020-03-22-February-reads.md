Some interesting things I read in February, with a fits-in-a-tweet summary:

* How we improved our sprints when we stopped estimating stories. Never leave a process unquestioned. Inspect and adapt worrying less about processes and focusing more on agile values.

* Beware of private conversations. "Changing an organization to be open and transparent is a huge undertaking, but one that has tremendous benefits. Luckily, kickstarting the change can be as easy as moving your own conversations out into the open."

* Is Organization Structure More Important Than Company Culture? Team culture eats company culture for breakfast. The structure of the company should be so designed that it enables teams to develop their own culture.

* The (discontinued, but still interesting) Medium engineering growth framework.

* Postel's Law: "We should never try to communicate poorly, but we should always strive to practice radical empathy for others' words - we canâ€™t control what was said, but we are in complete control of our reaction to it"
